## MailChimp Widget ##
Adds a widget that allows your users to sign up for your MailChimp mailing list.

## Description ##

This plugin provides an easy, lightweight way to let your users sign up for your MailChimp list. You can use it to sign up users for
several different lists by creating multiple instances of the widget. Once a user has signed up, a cookie is stored on their machine to
prevent the sign up form for that particular list from displaying. Sign ups for other lists will display.

The MailChimp Widget:

*	is easy to use
*	is AJAX-enabled, but degrades gracefully if Javascript isn't turned on
*	encourages the collection of only information that you actually need (i.e., an email address) to send your mailers
